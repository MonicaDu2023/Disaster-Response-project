# Disaster-Response-project
The project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model and show result in a web app. This project is divided in the following key sections:
* Data Processing: ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a database
* Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories
* Web App to show model results in real time.
# Installation
* Python 3.5+ (I used Python 3.7)
* Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sciki-Learn
* Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK
